Questions for Christophe and Pradal:

How to evolve data, are there step sizes? What if there's a dependency, how does it increment?
Is there a way to import OBJs with textures? If not is there a way to integrate OpenGL?
Is there a way to export metadata attached to vertices? Things like "leaf number" or "vertex age"?
OpenGL integration for instancing?
