#Soybean plant L-System
#Basic symbols to know: 
#  F - one default segment length
#  F(1.5) - one segment of length 1.5
#  H - one default segment half-length
#  J - instance of “berry” (cotyledon) geometry
#  K(scale,0,leaf#) - instance of leaf geometry
#  t - generation number
#  T - apply gravity
#  b - manually set in the L-system values to generate a different id for each plant

#The premise starts with B, which includes stem and cotyledons. Cotyledon branches are in [ ] brackets. A is the rest of the plant.
#  Hard-coded 30.4mm internode and 25mm petiole
#  petiole 1 angle Hard-coded to 90 degrees
B = F[+FJ][-FJ]A

#Generation 2 is the first implementation of rule A, which grows two mono-leaves
#  Hard-coded 30.4mm internode and 25mm petiole
#  petiole 1 angle generated by identical poly calls
A:t<=2 = "!F[+FK(1,0,0,5.0,9.8)][-FK(1,0,0,5.0,9.8)]A

#Future generations alternate left and right
#  internode length generated by identical calls to poly inside F()
#  petiole 1 angle generated by identical calls to poly inside [] square brackets
A:(t>2)&(t%2) = "!F[+Q]A
A:(t>2)&((t%2)+1) = "!F[-Q]A

#Structure of the trifoliate leaves
#  petiole length generated by call to poly() and divided by ten to convert to millimeters
#  petioliole length hard-coded to 34
#  petiole 2 angle hard-coded to 175
#  leaf width hard-coded to 5.0
#  leaf height hard-coded to 9.8
