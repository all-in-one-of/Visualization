#Soybean plant L-System
#Basic symbols to know: 
#  F - one default segment length
#  F(1.5) - one segment of length 1.5
#  H - one default segment half-length
#  J - instance of “berry” (cotyledon) geometry
#  K(scale,0,leaf#) - instance of leaf geometry
#  t - generation number

#The premise starts with B, which includes stem and cotyledons. Cotyledon branches are in [ ] brackets. A is the rest of the plant.
B = FF[+HJ][-HJ]A

#Generation 2 is the first implementation of rule A, which grows two mono-leaves
A:t<=2 = "!FF[+TTH//TK(1,0,0)][-TTH\\TK(1,0,0)]A

#Future generations alternate left and right
A:(t>2)&(t%2) = "!FF[+TQ]A
A:(t>2)&((t%2)+1) = "!FF[-TQ]A

#Structure of the trifoliate leaves
#  b is length of petiole - b needs to be defined in Houdini “Values” tab
#  petioliole length is being generated by a series of calls to a uniform random distribution
