#Soybean plant L-System
#Basic symbols to know: 
#  F - one default segment length
#  F(1.5) - one segment of length 1.5
#  H - one default segment half-length
#  J - instance of “berry” (cotyledon) geometry
#  K(scale,0,leaf#) - instance of leaf geometry
#  M - instance of a branch
#  t - generation number
#  T - apply gravity
#  b - manually set in the L-system values to generate a different id for each plant
#  c - std as a proportion of mean (do not exceed 1)

#The premise starts with B, which includes stem and cotyledons. Cotyledon branches are in [ ] brackets. A is the rest of the plant.
#  Hard-coded 30.4mm internode and 25mm petiole
#  petiole 1 angle Hard-coded to 90 degrees
